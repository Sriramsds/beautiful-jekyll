# Impressionist

A lightweight plugin that logs impressions per action or manually per model

## Why impressionist?

When you're a web developer many times a client will ask you to show a Views text somewhere.

For example, how many views does this Profile have? How many views does this Car listing have?

In Ruby on Rails, there's a very clean and simple Gem that allows you to quickly and correctly add this functionality to your website.
