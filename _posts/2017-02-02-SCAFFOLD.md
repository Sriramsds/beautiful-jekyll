# SCAFFOLD: A QUICKEST WAY OF BUILDING A BLOG WITH POSTS AND COMMENTS
Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails refers to the auto-generation of a set of a model, views, and a controller usually used for a single database table.
For example, you can auto-generate a ready to use controller, model, and views with a full **CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete)** web interface for the Story table using the following command:
1. Scaffolding was made popular by the Rails framework.
2. When line scaffold :model_name is added to a controller, Rails will automatically generate all the appropriate data interfaces at run time.
3. An external command can also be used to generate Ruby code for the scaffold in advance, which is rails generate scaffold model_name. The generated script will produce files of Ruby code that application can use to interact with database.

> **It's way easier to do this, instead of coding everything yourself, it saves you a lot of time!**

## Lets Jump in to action
1. The first thing we need to do is to create the Rails application:
```ruby
$ rails new blog
```
2.In the blog app directory, use the scaffold generator to create the MVC components needed for posts and comments:
```ruby

$ cd blog
$ rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text
$ rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text

```
it will generate the following action
```
 invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20180522054949_create_posts.rb
      create    app/models/post.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/post_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/posts.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :posts
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/posts
      create      app/views/posts/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/_form.html.erb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/posts_controller_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/posts_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      invoke    jbuilder
      create      app/views/posts/index.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/posts/show.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/posts/_post.json.jbuilder
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/system/posts_test.rb
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/posts.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/posts.scss
      invoke  scss
      create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss
      
```
3.Create the post and comment database tables:
```ruby

$ rails db:migrate
```
it will generate
```

= 20180522054949 CreatePosts: migrating ======================================
-- create_table(:posts)
   -> 0.0009s
== 20180522054949 CreatePosts: migrated (0.0009s) =============================

```
4. In order to view the routes
```ruby

$ rake routes

```
it will shows  the routes for ur application
```
   Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    comments GET    /comments(.:format)          comments#index
             POST   /comments(.:format)          comments#create
 new_comment GET    /comments/new(.:format)      comments#new
edit_comment GET    /comments/:id/edit(.:format) comments#edit
     comment GET    /comments/:id(.:format)      comments#show
             PATCH  /comments/:id(.:format)      comments#update
             PUT    /comments/:id(.:format)      comments#update
             DELETE /comments/:id(.:format)      comments#destroy
       posts GET    /posts(.:format)             posts#index
             POST   /posts(.:format)             posts#create
    new_post GET    /posts/new(.:format)         posts#new
   edit_post GET    /posts/:id/edit(.:format)    posts#edit
        post GET    /posts/:id(.:format)         posts#show
             PATCH  /posts/:id(.:format)         posts#update
             PUT    /posts/:id(.:format)         posts#update
             DELETE /posts/:id(.:format)         posts#destroy
             
 ```
5. In order to run the appication :
```ruby
$ rails s
```

### Warning
> **While scaffolding will get you up and running quickly, 
the code it generates is unlikely to be a perfect fit for your application. 
You'll most probably want to customize the generated code. 
Many experienced Rails developers avoid scaffolding entirely, 
preferring to write all or most of their source code from scratch.**

## Destroy
Everyone is free to edit and make the necessary changes to their application so that it works as intended, even if it means completely removing scaffold. You can remove scaffold in the following way:
If you migrated your files, perform a rollback: 
```ruby

$rake db:rollback

```
Destroy or undo scaffold:

```ruby

$rails destroy scaffold Story

```
By doing this, you will delete all the files created by the scaffold but additional changes that you may have done manually will not be removed.
